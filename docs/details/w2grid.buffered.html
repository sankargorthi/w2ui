Number of buffered records.

<div class="definition">
	Integer, default = 0
</div>

This property only applies if your data source for the grid is remote. As of 1.3, the default behavior of the grid is infinite 
scroll, which means as user scrolls more records will be loaded. As user scrolls and more records are retrieved from the server,
previous records are not discarded, but are stored in <span class="argument">.records</span> array.
<div style="height: 10px"></div>

You can also see the number of buffered records in the status bar. There are a set of events that will clean buffered records.
Those events are
<ul>
	<li>User applies a new search
	<li>You call <a class="argument" href="w2grid.clear">.clear()</a> method
	<li>You call <a class="argument" href="w2grid.skip">.skip()</a> method
</ul>

There is no need to change this property directly, as grid trys to keep this property updated. But in some cases you might need
to change it, for example, when you manually manipulate <span class="argument">.records</span> array.
<div style="height: 10px"></div>

To change it during run-time:
<textarea class="javascript">
w2ui['grid'].buffered = 0;
</textarea>
